        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a final project in a team of 2 for module where we were learning assembly 
            programming. Every programmer needs a calculator of some form in their portfolio so we 
            decided that ours will be written in assembly. The main focus of this project was to 
            create a simple UI with dynamic user feedback to resemble nowadays calculator apps. 
            It is made for Motorola 86k and we used Easy 68k simulator. We made presentation and 
            report papers to go with this project as well.</p>
