        <h1>Forgotten night</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We were supposed to create web-game that uses canvas, form for user customization, 
            Web Storage API for consistent data storage between sessions and complies with PWA 
            standards so the game can be installed for offline use. The topic was time travel and 
            the story of my game is that you woke up in a strange house. You are hangover and don’t 
            remember what you did last night or how you got here. Suddenly a magical fairy appears 
            and helps you to remember your night. The aim is to fight 5 strangers to remember more. 
            Due to lack of time, I didn’t create all the assets so now you are fighting yourself. 
            The game is playable on mobile thanks to the joystick and buttons. </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Storage API, PWA, Json</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>I wanted to create real life stop-motion animation as it is not widely used and I wanted 
            to experiment. The pictures for the animation are taken by me and I also created all the
             UI elements. I wanted it to look funny as opposed to nice and clean UI that is seen 
             everywhere. It was a great opportunity to be able to experiment with something like this. </p>
