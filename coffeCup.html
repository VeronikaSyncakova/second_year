        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This was voluntary project in a team of 5 for a competition Called Games Fleadh that is 
            sponsored by companies such as EA. Our team consisted of 3 programmers, one artist and 
            one sound designer. Everything in the game was made by us. As this was work outside of 
            our school time and we were working on it remotely, we had to learn how to properly 
            function in a team. We created this game in 3 weeks including the planning phase. 
            Communication was key as we had to adjust the workflow during the stressful times, long 
            nights and daily demos of the progress. Luckly the hard work paid off as it won 2 awards 
            at the competition. It was our first released game and now you can download it from 
            itch.io and play it on your machine. </p>
        <p>It is a coffee shop simulation. You are playing as a space barista and you want to 
            keep the customers happy, earn money and develop you skills through different 
            achievements.</p>
        <p>Some things we were proud of include radial menus with easing functions, pre-caching of 
            assets for faster execution, finite state machine, singleton pattern.</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>C++, SFML library, text file</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>All the art assets were made by our artist and all the sound effects and music was made 
            by our sound designer.</p>
