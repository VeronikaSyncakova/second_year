        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This was a 2 week joint project across all our modules in a team of 2. It is a top down 
            shooter where you are playing as a nurse that takes care of blind patients. You have to 
            get all the medication before the patients seek you out. You can customize your character 
            and build your own level thanks to the level editor and data saving to yaml file. You 
            can also choose between different enemy behavior types. The game uses spatial partition 
            and enemies have vision cone for more efficient collision checks. There is also particle 
            system for visual effects. </p>
        <p>As one part of this project we had to create user stories, crc cards and uml diagrams 
            using mermaid. The code follows SOLID principles and uses observer, strategy and 
            singleton patterns. </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>C++, SFML library, Yaml, Mermaid for UML diagram</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>All the assets are made by us using Aesprite. </p>
